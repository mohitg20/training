ROS tasks for AUV , I am in the middle of the ROS Tutorial. Have completed till tutorial 10 and will try my best to finish it in following 3-4 days. I was having a lot of academic backlog and needed to finish it as first priority as all quizzes are approaching. Also involved in two other projects of game dev and full stack web developement and running 1-2 week behind in those too. Having so many continuous quizes, It was tough to do the assignment.
